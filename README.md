# Snake and Ladder Game



## Description

This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Snake and Ladder game in Python. The game simulates the board game where players take turns rolling a dice and moving their positions based on the roll. The game includes both snakes that send players backward and ladders that help players climb higher.

## Features

- Supports two players.
- Simulates dice rolls and updates player positions.
- Includes snakes that send players backward.
- Includes ladders that help players climb forward.
- Displays the current player's position after each turn.
- Announces the winner when a player reaches or exceeds position 100.

## How to Play

1. Run the `snake_and_ladder.py` script using Python.
2. Players take turns rolling the dice by pressing Enter.
3. The rolled dice value determines the number of steps the player moves.
4. If a player lands on a snake's head, they move back to the tail.
5. If a player lands on the base of a ladder, they climb to the top.
6. The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds position 100.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
